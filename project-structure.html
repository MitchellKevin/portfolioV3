            <section id="attention-grabber"><i>Imagine being an elderly person, living alone, and having a friendly robot not only guide you through simple exercises but also chat with you to brighten your day. That’s what I wanted to achieve with FitBot, a mix of movement, companionship, and technology working together.</i></section>
            <section id="project-description">The NAO Control App was developed to help older adults stay physically active while also offering social interaction through the NAO humanoid robot (FitBot).<br><br>
Through the Android app, users could:
<li>
    <ul>Select personalized training programs tailored to elderly mobility.</ul>
    <ul>Exercise with NAO as it demonstrated routines in an engaging, motivating way.</ul>
    <ul>Have conversations with the robot, reducing loneliness by providing a digital buddy.</ul>
</li>
On the technical side, I built the app in Android Studio (Java/XML) and set up communication between the app and the NAO robot using the MQTT protocol. This ensured real-time interaction: when users selected a training or conversational option, the NAO robot responded immediately.
This project brought together mobile development, robotics, and human-centered design, showing how technology can enrich daily life for the elderly.</section>
